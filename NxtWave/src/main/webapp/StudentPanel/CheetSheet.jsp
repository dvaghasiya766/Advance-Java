                In Python, you can check if a variable is mutable or immutable by trying to modify it and
                observing its behavior. Here's a simple way to do this:
                Write a code for Given a list of integers, write a program to identify contiguous sub-list that has the
                largest sum and
                print the sub-list. Any non-empty slice of the list with step size 1 can be considered as contiguous
                sub-list.
